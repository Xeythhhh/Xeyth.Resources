# 📝 Commit Standard

This document outlines our internal commit message standard, designed to improve clarity, automation, and collaboration across teams. It is based on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification and extended with ergonomic conventions that support semantic versioning, CI/CD workflows, changelogs, and more.

---

## 📌 Structure

A commit message consists of:

```xml
<type>(scope): <summary>

- <bullet describing what changed>
- <bullet describing why or how, if relevant>

BREAKING CHANGE: <optional breaking change description>
<metadata @key:value>
```

Notes:

- **Scope** is optional but recommended.
- **BREAKING CHANGE** is optional but must appear before any metadata.
- **Metadata** are prefixed with `@` and placed on the final line.

## ✅ Accepted Commit Types

| Type       | Purpose                                                     |

## 🧩 Metadata Footer Format

All machine-readable metadata must be placed in the **footer**, on the final line(s) of the commit message. Each entry:

- Begins with `@`
- Uses a `key:value` format
- Is separated by spaces (single-line preferred)

| Metadata Key | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Example         |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `@semver`    | Overrides [GitVersion](https://gitversion.net) version bumping                                                                                                                                                      | `@semver:minor` |
| `@issue`     | Links to an issue (e.g. [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues), [Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/about-work-items)) | `@issue:342`    |
| `@nuke`      | Triggers [Nuke](https://nuke.build/) build targets in CI/CD pipelines                                                                                                                                               | `@nuke:feature` |

This list is extensible — future metadata tags may be added as tooling evolves.

## 🔠 Format Examples

### 🟢 Minimal Commit

```text
feat(core): add login button
```

### 🟡 Typical Commit With Bullet Points

```text
fix(auth): prevent double form submission

- Added submit lock to prevent re-triggering
- Prevents rapid keypresses on Enter
```

### 🔵 Commit With Metadata Footer

```text
chore(assets): move icons to Icons folder

- Cleaned up folder structure for clarity
- Updated all import paths to match

@issue:122 @nuke:test
```

### 🔴 Commit With Breaking Change + Metadata

```text
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 provider support

- Added external identity provider integration
- Refactored login and token validation logic

BREAKING CHANGE: Existing SSO flows must be updated
@semver:minor @issue:340 @nuke:feature
```

> 📄 This is a living standard. As we add tools (e.g., changelogs, release notes, custom bots), we can expand supported `@key:` formats while preserving this ergonomic base.
